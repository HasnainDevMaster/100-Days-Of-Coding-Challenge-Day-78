What are Web Vitals? https://roadmap.sh/guides/what-are-web-vitals

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Web Vitals are a set of performance metrics introduced by Google to quantify and improve user experience on the web.
These metrics provide insights into key areas of website performance, such as loading speed,
interactivity, and visual stability.By focusing on these aspects, developers can create websites that are fast,
responsive, and stable, leading to improved user satisfaction and higher search engine rankings.

Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are a subset of Web Vitals that focus on the most critical elements of user experience.
They measure three essential aspects:

1. Loading Performance (Largest Contentful Paint - LCP):

    * What it measures: LCP tracks the time it takes for the largest content element
    (such as an image, video, or block of text) on the page to load and become visible to the user.

    * Why it matters: A fast LCP ensures that users can quickly see the most important content on the page,
    improving perceived load times.

    * Ideal threshold: Less than 2.5 seconds.

    * Optimization strategies: Compress and optimize images, reduce server response times using CDNs and caching,
    and minimize render-blocking CSS and JavaScript.

2. Interactivity (First Input Delay - FID):

    * What it measures: FID quantifies the time it takes for a web page to respond to the first interaction,
    such as a button click or a link.

    * Why it matters: A low FID means users can interact with the page without frustrating delays,
    leading to a more responsive experience.

    * Ideal threshold: Less than 100 milliseconds.

    * Optimization strategies: Minimize JavaScript execution time, defer non-essential JavaScript,
    and break long tasks into smaller chunks.

3. Visual Stability (Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS):

    * What it measures: CLS evaluates how stable the page layout is during the loading process.
    It tracks unexpected layout shifts that can happen when images, ads, or dynamic content are loaded after other elements.

    * Why it matters: A low CLS ensures that users do not experience jarring movements or content shifts,
    which can lead to poor usability.

    * Ideal threshold: Less than 0.1.

    * Optimization strategies: Always reserve space for images and ads,
    avoid inserting new content above existing content unless triggered by user action, and specify size attributes for media elements.

Other Important Web Vitals
In addition to Core Web Vitals, several other metrics help developers gauge different aspects of performance:

    * First Contentful Paint (FCP): Measures the time it takes for the browser to render the first piece of DOM content, such as text or images.
    This is the first visual feedback users receive that the page is loading.

    * Time to Interactive (TTI): Evaluates how long it takes for a page to become fully interactive,
    meaning that it can respond to user input.

    * Total Blocking Time (TBT): Tracks the amount of time during which the main thread is blocked by long tasks,
    preventing the page from becoming interactive.

    * Time to First Byte (TTFB): Measures how long it takes for the server to respond with the first byte of data.

Why Web Vitals Matter
Optimizing Web Vitals is essential for several reasons:

1. User Experience: Websites with fast load times, responsive interactivity,
and stable layouts offer a superior experience, leading to higher user engagement and satisfaction.

2. Search Engine Ranking: Google uses Web Vitals as part of its ranking algorithm.
Websites that perform well in these areas are more likely to rank higher in search results.

3. Business Benefits: Fast, responsive, and stable websites are more likely to convert visitors into customers or subscribers.
Improving Web Vitals can directly impact key metrics like conversion rates, retention, and overall revenue.

Conclusion
Web Vitals are a crucial tool for developers seeking to improve the user experience of their websites.
By focusing on Core Web Vitals—LCP, FID, and CLS—as well as other supplementary metrics like FCP and TTI,
developers can ensure that their websites are optimized for speed, responsiveness, and visual stability.
These improvements not only enhance user satisfaction but also help with SEO performance, driving better business outcomes.
